		<p>Spring Security is a Java/Java EE framework that provides authentication, authorization and other security 
		features for enterprise applications. The project was started in late 2003 as 
		'Acegi Security' (pronounced Ah-see-gee, whose letters are characters 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 from the English alphabet,</p>
		in order to prevent name conflicts[2]) by Ben Alex, with it being publicly released under the Apache License in March 2004. 
		Subsequently, Acegi was incorporated into the Spring portfolio as Spring Security, an official Spring sub-project. 
		The first public release under the new name was Spring Security 2.0.0 in April 2008, with commercial support and training available from SpringSource.
